Excel files (apart from one, which is in .txt(convertable to .csv), because of Excel exporting limits) represent the data from the database of the Blinken OSA's RFE/FEC Collection of telex messages. Originally, the database was build in Microsoft Access, so the same logic can be applied to recreate the connections. Use the ID lists to create connections between entries and files. SEE THE SCREENSHOT OF THE DB STRUCTURE in the repository. 



They include both database items (people, corporations, countries, time, date, notes, etc.) and connection between them(using the ID lists and ID matches).
