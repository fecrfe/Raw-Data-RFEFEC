Excel files (apart from one, which is in txt, because of size) represent the data from the database of the Blinken OSA's RFE/FEC Collection of telex messages. 

They include both database items (people, corporations, countries, time, date, notes, etc.) and connection between them(using the ID lists and ID matches). 

Originally, the database was build in Microsoft access, so the same logic can be applied to recreate the connections.
